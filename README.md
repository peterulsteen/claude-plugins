ClosedLoop is an AI platform that brings the speed of individual AI-driven development to the full software development team. We're offering our agents as open sourced Claude Code plugins because we just couldn't keep this a secret for ourselves — check out our agents for planning, code reviews, judging quality and more that outperform Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.5 out of the box.

**Bootstrap. Plan. Code. Ship.** It's that simple.

LLMs are great at non-deterministic content generation — horrible at being repeatably correct.

That's why we took Claude Code and extended it with a lightweight multi-agent orchestration workflow paradigm that works for us; modeling how we collaborate as a team.

Optimized for efficiency & correctness to produce code that lands without the churn; it's grounded in your codebase and outperforms Opus 4.6 out of the box at half the cost.

What's more impactful is that it allowed our team of engineers to shift left; reviewing and approving sprints-worth of work scope in documented implementation plans and generating the code while we slept.

Tickets become Tasks. Epics become Features. Sections of your quarterly roadmap land in a few PRs.

Multi-repository, adaptive self-learning, & artifact-bound phased workflow gates that loop until correct.

**Close the Loop on your SDLC with the same tools that made us 400% faster today.**

# judges

A collection of specialized LLM judge agents that evaluate implementation plans and code artifacts against software engineering principles and best practices. Judges run in parallel, score artifacts using a structured `CaseScore` JSON schema, and aggregate results into a validation report.

## Features

- **13 plan judges** covering DRY, SSOT, KISS, SOLID principles, code organization, readability, verbosity, goal alignment, test quality, technical accuracy, and custom best practices
- **11 code judges** — the same set minus goal-alignment and verbosity judges, which are plan-specific
- **4 grounding judges** that leverage `investigation-log.md` to verify plan accuracy against actual codebase state (brownfield accuracy, codebase grounding, convention adherence, code review)
- **Parallel execution** via batched Task calls (up to 4 concurrent judges per batch)
- **Structured output** using a validated `CaseScore` JSON schema with Pydantic enforcement
- **Artifact compression** to keep large artifacts within token budgets before judge invocation
- **Evaluation caching** to skip redundant plan evaluations when the plan has not changed
- **Configurable thresholds** via JSON override files at run-level or repo-level
- **Performance telemetry** written to `perf.jsonl` for each pipeline phase

The `eval-cache` skill short-circuits plan evaluation when `plan-evaluation.json` is newer than `plan.json`, avoiding redundant judge runs.

The `artifact-type-tailored-context` skill compresses individual artifact files within a token budget using tiered summarization (full content, intelligent compression, or hard truncation) before passing them to judges.

## Judge Agents

All judges output a `CaseScore` JSON object with:
- `type`: `"case_score"`
- `case_id`: judge identifier
- `final_status`: `1` (pass), `2` (fail/conditional pass), or `3` (error)
- `metrics`: array of scored dimensions with `metric_name`, `threshold`, `score` (0.0 / 0.5 / 1.0), and `justification`

---

### brownfield-accuracy-judge

**Evaluates:** How accurately an implementation plan accounts for existing code — correctly identifying what to modify vs create, avoiding reimplementation, and finding the right integration points.

---

### codebase-grounding-judge

**Evaluates:** Whether an implementation plan is grounded in codebase reality by comparing plan claims against the investigation log. Detects hallucinated file paths, nonexistent modules, and fabricated APIs.

**Model:** opus

**Investigation-log dependency:** If `investigation-log.md` is absent, all metrics score 0.5 with `final_status = 2` (FAIL — unverifiable). The judge does not access the filesystem directly.

---

### convention-adherence-judge

**Evaluates:** Whether an implementation plan follows the conventions, patterns, and style found in the actual codebase, as documented in the investigation log.

**Model:** sonnet

**Reads from `$CLOSEDLOOP_WORKDIR`:** `investigation-log.md`, `plan.json`, `prd.md`

**Metrics (3):**

**Used in:** Code evaluation only.

---

## Grounding Judges and investigation-log.md

The four grounding judges (brownfield-accuracy, codebase-grounding, convention-adherence, code-review) use `investigation-log.md` as ground truth to verify plan quality against the actual codebase. This investigation log is produced during pre-exploration and documents real files, modules, conventions, and integration points.

**Key design decisions:**
- If `investigation-log.md` is absent, grounding judges score all metrics at 0.5 and return `final_status = 2` (FAIL — unverifiable) rather than attempting to evaluate
- These judges do not access the filesystem directly (except code-review-judge for git diffs); they rely solely on the investigation log
- They are the primary differentiators between plans written with codebase context (ClosedLoop) and plans written blind (OOTB)

---

## Tools

### Benchmarks (`tools/python/benchmarks/`)

E2E benchmark pipeline for measuring judge quality and performance.

- **score_report.py** — Parses judge reports, computes per-judge mean scores, compares against baselines, checks thresholds, and generates markdown reports for PR comments. Supports 3-tier comparison (OOTB model vs ClosedLoop main vs current PR).
- **test_benchmarks.py** — Deterministic pytest suite validating fixture integrity, token usage, artifact quality, and performance event analysis against `thresholds.json`.
- **perf_summary.py** — Performance telemetry analysis tool that summarizes iterations, pipeline steps, sub-steps, and agent timings from `perf.jsonl`.

---

## Skills

### run-judges

Orchestrates parallel judge agent execution, aggregates `CaseScore` results, and validates output.

**Parameters:**
- `--artifact-type`: `plan` (default) or `code`

**Plan mode** (default):
- Reads `prd.md` and `plan.json` from `$CLOSEDLOOP_WORKDIR`
- Runs 13 judges in 4 sequential batches (max 4 concurrent per batch)
- Writes `$CLOSEDLOOP_WORKDIR/judges.json`

**Code mode** (`--artifact-type code`):
- Launches `context-manager-for-judges` agent to produce `code-context.json`
- Prepends `code_preamble.md` to each judge prompt
- Runs 11 judges in 3 sequential batches
- Writes `$CLOSEDLOOP_WORKDIR/code-judges.json`

**Threshold overrides** are loaded from (in order of precedence):
1. `$CLOSEDLOOP_WORKDIR/.claude/settings/threshold-overrides.json`
2. `<project-root>/.claude/settings/threshold-overrides.json`
3. Built-in defaults

**Output validation** is run after writing the report using `scripts/validate_judge_report.py`. The skill retries until validation passes.

---

### artifact-type-tailored-context

Compresses individual artifact files within a token budget before judge invocation. Runs in a forked context to avoid polluting the parent agent's context window.

**Parameters:** `artifact_path`, `task_description`, `token_budget`

**Compression tiers:**
1. **Full content** — artifact fits within budget; returned unchanged
2. **Intelligent compression** — artifact is 1x–1.5x the budget; applies artifact-type-specific summarization (code diffs preserve function signatures, JSON arrays are truncated, log files keep errors/warnings, plan markdown keeps headings and code blocks)
3. **Hard truncation** — artifact exceeds 1.5x the budget; truncated at paragraph boundary with a `[TRUNCATED]` marker

**Returns:** JSON with `artifact_name`, `raw_tokens`, `compacted_tokens`, `truncated`, and `content`.

---

### eval-cache

Checks for a cached plan evaluation result before launching the plan-evaluator agent.

**When to use:** At the start of Phase 1.3 (Simple Mode Evaluation), before launching `@code:plan-evaluator`.

**Freshness check:** Compares modification timestamps of `plan-evaluation.json` and `plan.json`. If `plan.json` is newer, returns `EVAL_CACHE_MISS`; otherwise returns `EVAL_CACHE_HIT` with cached `simple_mode`, `selected_critics`, and `summary`.

---

## Usage

### Evaluating an Implementation Plan

1. Ensure `$CLOSEDLOOP_WORKDIR/prd.md` and `$CLOSEDLOOP_WORKDIR/plan.json` exist.
2. Invoke the `run-judges` skill (default artifact type is `plan`):

```
@judges:run-judges
```

3. Results are written to `$CLOSEDLOOP_WORKDIR/judges.json`.

### Evaluating Implemented Code

1. Ensure code artifacts (git diff, changed files, build results) are available in `$CLOSEDLOOP_WORKDIR`.
2. Invoke the `run-judges` skill with the code artifact type:

```
@judges:run-judges --artifact-type code
```

3. The skill runs `context-manager-for-judges` first to produce `code-context.json`, then launches 11 judges.
4. Results are written to `$CLOSEDLOOP_WORKDIR/code-judges.json`.

### Configuring Threshold Overrides

Create a JSON file at `$CLOSEDLOOP_WORKDIR/.claude/settings/threshold-overrides.json` (run-specific) or `<project-root>/.claude/settings/threshold-overrides.json` (repo-wide):

```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "code:test-judge": 0.75,
    "plan:technical-accuracy-judge": 0.85
  }
}
```

Key format: `"artifact_type:judge_name"`. Valid artifact types: `plan`, `code`.

### Output Format

Each judge produces a `CaseScore`:

```json
{
  "type": "case_score",
  "case_id": "dry-judge",
  "final_status": 1,
  "metrics": [
    {
      "metric_name": "dry_score",
      "threshold": 0.8,
      "score": 0.9,
      "justification": "No duplication detected. T-2.1 creates a shared auth utility used by T-3.1, T-3.2, and T-3.3."
    }
  ]
}
```

The aggregated report (`judges.json` or `code-judges.json`) wraps all `CaseScore` objects:

```json
{
  "report_id": "{RUN_ID}-judges",
  "timestamp": "2024-02-03T15:45:30Z",
  "stats": [ ... ]
}
```

# Codebase Grounding Judge

You are evaluating whether an implementation plan accurately reflects the real codebase — or whether it hallucinates structure, files, modules, or APIs that don't exist.

This judge is the primary differentiator between plans written with codebase context (CL) and plans written blind (OOTB).

## Input Files

Read from `$CLOSEDLOOP_WORKDIR`:
1. **investigation-log.md** — ground truth about the codebase: real files, modules, conventions, patterns
2. **plan.json** — the plan to evaluate
3. **prd.md** — the requirements (for context on what's genuinely new)

**If investigation-log.md is absent:** Score all metrics 0.5 with justification "No investigation log — claims unverifiable." Do not attempt to evaluate. Do not access the filesystem.

## What to Evaluate

Extract from plan.json:
- File paths proposed in `pendingTasks[].file`
- Module/class/function names referenced in task descriptions and `content`
- Import statements and dependency references
- Claims about what "already exists" in the codebase
- Proposed integration points with existing code

Then cross-reference each claim against investigation-log.md:

### Metric 1: `file_path_accuracy` (threshold: 0.8)

For each file path in the plan:
- **Existing file being modified**: Is it confirmed in investigation-log? If yes, correct.
- **New file being created**: Is its directory consistent with project structure shown in investigation-log? If yes, plausible.
- **Hallucinated path**: Path contradicts investigation-log structure (wrong directory depth, wrong naming convention, module doesn't match project layout). Flag as hallucination.

Score:
- **1.0**: All paths either confirmed by investigation-log or structurally consistent with it
- **0.5**: 1–2 paths are unverifiable or inconsistent but no clear contradictions
- **0.0**: One or more paths directly contradict investigation-log (e.g., file claimed to exist that doesn't, path uses wrong module structure)

### Metric 2: `module_reference_accuracy` (threshold: 0.8)

For each module, class, function, or API referenced:
- Is it confirmed in investigation-log?
- Does it use the correct import path?
- Is the API usage consistent with what investigation-log shows?

Score:
- **1.0**: All references confirmed or consistent with investigation-log
- **0.5**: Some references unverifiable (not mentioned in investigation-log, but plausible)
- **0.0**: One or more references directly contradict investigation-log (wrong class name, wrong module path, API that doesn't exist in the codebase)

### Metric 3: `existing_code_awareness` (threshold: 0.8)

Does the plan correctly identify what already exists and what needs to be built?
- Does it avoid reimplementing things investigation-log shows already exist?
- Does it correctly identify files to modify vs files to create?
- Does it correctly identify existing utilities/helpers it should reuse?

Score:
- **1.0**: Plan correctly distinguishes existing vs new; reuses existing code where appropriate
- **0.5**: Plan is neutral — doesn't claim things exist that don't, but misses some reuse opportunities
- **0.0**: Plan proposes reimplementing code investigation-log confirms already exists, or claims files don't exist when they do

## Scoring

Compute `final_status`:
- All 3 metrics ≥ threshold → `final_status = 1` (PASS)
- Any metric < threshold → `final_status = 2` (FAIL)
- investigation-log.md absent → `final_status = 2` (FAIL — unverifiable)

## [Releases]

### code v1.5.1

#### Removed
- Removed judge integration from `run-loop.sh` — `run_judges_if_needed`, `has_code_changes`, `resolve_judges_agents_dir`, `ensure_agents_snapshot`, `store_agents_snapshot`, and `check_completion` functions removed along with Step 11 judge invocation in `post_iteration_processing`
- Deleted `run_judges_test_helper.sh` and `test_run_loop_imported_plan.py` (tests for removed judge functions)

#### Changed
- Refactored `run-loop.sh` workdir references to use a single `effective_workdir` local variable instead of repeated `${workdir:-$WORKDIR}` expansions

### judges v1.4.0

#### Added
- Agents snapshot pre-step in `run-judges` skill — creates `$CLOSEDLOOP_WORKDIR/agents-snapshot/` with all judge agent `.md` files and a `manifest.json` before judge execution begins (skipped if snapshot already exists)
- New `ensure_agents_snapshot.sh` script in `run-judges` skill scripts

#### Changed
- Renamed plan evaluation output from `judges.json` to `plan-judges.json` for consistency with `code-judges.json` and `prd-judges.json`
- Updated `validate_judge_report.py` default filename for plan category to `plan-judges.json`

### code v1.5.0

### Added
- `--self-learning` opt-in flag for `run-loop.sh` -- self-learning is now disabled by default
- `CLOSEDLOOP_SELF_LEARNING` config propagation via `config.env` and state frontmatter
- Self-learning guard in `subagent-start-hook.sh` to skip learning injection when disabled
- Self-learning guard in `subagent-stop-hook.sh` to skip entire learning region when disabled
- Self-learning guard in `pretooluse-hook.sh` to skip tool-specific pattern injection when disabled

### Changed
- `post_iteration_processing()` skips steps 2-10 when self-learning is off; step 1 (changed-files.json) and step 11 (judges) always run
- `bootstrap_learnings()` skips `.learnings/` directory creation when self-learning is off
- `run_background_pruning()` skips pruning when self-learning is off
- Resume restores `SELF_LEARNING` from state frontmatter and re-exports to hooks

### code v1.4.1

#### Added
- New `feedback-explorer` agent (haiku) for pre-fetching codebase context referenced in reviewer feedback, reducing redundant exploration during plan revisions with delta caching across debate rounds
- Deferral detection in `plan-with-codex` -- scans plans for "Deferred", "Out of Scope", "Future Work" items and requires explicit user approval before excluding work from scope
- Exclusions sidecar file (`{stem}.exclusions`) in `plan-with-codex` to persist user-confirmed deferral decisions across debate rounds

#### Changed
- `plan-with-codex` argument-hint updated to positional syntax instead of optional bracket notation
- `plan-with-codex` uses Write tool for state persistence instead of Bash printf
- `plan-with-codex` launches `feedback-explorer` before `plan-agent` revision rounds to pre-fetch context
- `plan-agent` enforces "no silent deferrals" rule -- must not create deferred/out-of-scope sections without explicit user approval
- `plan-agent` supports pre-fetched context briefs from `feedback-explorer`, reads brief before revision to skip redundant exploration
- Added `Write` tool to `plan-agent` tools list

#### Fixed
- Fixed `plan-with-codex` to use fully qualified agent name `code:feedback-explorer`

### platform v1.0.2

#### Added
- New "Refactoring Existing Prompts" section in `context-engineering` skill covering pitfalls for stale cross-references, over-abstraction, lost preconditions, and silent behavior changes

### code v1.2.1

#### Changed
- `plan-agent` now verifies Codex findings against the codebase before acting -- rejects findings that don't hold up with evidence, writes a revision summary for cross-round context
- `codex-review` skill accepts `--revisions-file` parameter, injecting Claude's revision summary into Codex's prompt on rounds > 1 so rejected findings are not re-raised

#### Fixed
- Fixed `plan-with-codex` resume path triggering a redundant user review checkpoint when the user had already confirmed by choosing "resume with existing plan"

### code v1.2.0

#### Added
- New `plan-agent` agent for creating and revising implementation plans via codebase exploration
- New `plan-with-codex` command for iterative plan refinement through Claude + Codex debate loops
- New `codex-review` skill to run Codex plan reviews and return structured verdict feedback
- New `debate-loop.sh` script providing standalone CLI for Claude + Codex debate orchestration
- New `plan-review.sh` hook that triggers Codex review when Claude exits plan mode

### code-review v1.2.0

#### Added
- New `resolve-scope` subcommand in `code_review_helpers.py` -- deterministic scope resolution replacing inline shell logic for PR branch lookup, git fetch, base-ref overrides, and path filter preservation
- New `fetch-intent` subcommand -- fetches PR description or commit messages as intent context for the Premise Reviewer
- New `classify-intent` subcommand -- classifies diff intent (`feature`, `fix`, `refactor`, `mixed`) from PR metadata and file statuses for model routing
- New `collect-findings` subcommand -- merges `agent_*.json` files and hygiene findings into a single `findings.json`, replacing inline Python-in-Bash merge logic
- New `verdict` subcommand -- computes deterministic PR verdict (`approve`, `needs_attention`, `decline`) from validated findings, replacing inline orchestrator logic
- New `prep-assets` subcommand -- copies `shared_prompt.txt` and `bha_suffix.txt` from plugin to CR_DIR in a single step, consolidating scattered `cp` commands
- New `extract-patches` subcommand -- extracts per-partition and full-diff patches to disk with batched extraction for large diffs (>200 files)
- New `bha_suffix.txt` prompt file -- Bug Hunter A persona and focus areas extracted from inline heredoc in `start.md`
- Intent-aware model routing: Premise Reviewer uses Opus for fix/refactor/mixed intents, Sonnet for feature intents; BHA uses Opus for implementation partitions, Sonnet for test-only partitions
- Mixed-partition splitting in `partition` subcommand -- separates test files from implementation files when impl LOC exceeds threshold
- Agent cap enforcement via `--max-bha-agents` parameter in `partition`, computed from `route` output
- Trivial partition merging -- partitions below 20 LOC are absorbed into same-type normal partitions
- Cache status message (`status_kind`, `status_message`) appended to `cache_result.json` by `cache-check`, replacing orchestrator-side message formatting
- `--exclude-test-partitions` flag on `cache-update` to skip caching files from Sonnet-reviewed test-only partitions
- Self-discard validation rule (check 7) in `shared_prompt.txt` -- agents must discard findings they conclude are not actually problems

#### Changed
- Refactored `start.md` orchestrator to delegate workflow steps to Python subcommands instead of inline shell logic
- `setup` subcommand now accepts `--cr-dir-prefix` and creates CR_DIR with random suffix, removing the need for the orchestrator to generate random directory names
- `route` subcommand now accepts `--intent` parameter and outputs `max_bha_agents` for downstream partition cap enforcement
- Reduced default partition LOC budget from 800 to 500

### judges v1.3.1

#### Changed
- `run-judges` skill now accepts a `--workdir <path>` parameter for standalone use outside `run-loop.sh`; resolved in order: `--workdir` arg → `$CLOSEDLOOP_WORKDIR` env var → `.closedloop-ai/judges` default (directory created automatically if absent)

### code v1.1.4

#### Changed
- `run-loop.sh` judge invocations (`plan_judges`, `code_judges`) now pass `--workdir $workdir` explicitly in the `claude -p` prompt, aligning with the updated `run-judges` skill parameter contract

### judges v1.3.0

#### Added
- New `prd` artifact type support in `run-judges` skill — 4 dedicated PRD judges executed in 2-phase execution, output to `prd-judges.json`, validated with `--category prd`
- New `prd-auditor` agent — structural completeness auditor for draft PRDs; checks US/AC coverage, success metrics table completeness, critical open questions, scope section structure, kill criteria presence, and template section inventory
- New `prd-dependency-judge` agent — evaluates PRD dependency completeness and risk assessment; flags missing dependencies, underdefined integration points, and unacknowledged cross-team risks
- New `prd-testability-judge` agent — evaluates whether PRD acceptance criteria are testable and measurable; flags vague or unverifiable criteria and missing success metrics
- New `prd-scope-judge` agent — evaluates PRD scope discipline and hypothesis traceability; flags stories with no traceable origin, out-of-scope overlaps, story count exceeding 8, and unacknowledged dependencies; emits review-delta JSON
- New `prd_preamble.md` in `skills/artifact-type-tailored-context/preambles/` — artifact-type-tailored context preamble injected before PRD judge prompts
- `validate_judge_report.py`: Added `prd` category to `JUDGE_REGISTRY` with 4 expected judges (`prd-auditor`, `prd-dependency-judge`, `prd-testability-judge`, `prd-scope-judge`)
- `validate_judge_report.py`: Replaced `valid_suffixes` list with `VALID_SUFFIXES` dict mapping each category to its accepted `report_id` suffixes (`prd` maps to `["-prd-judges"]`)
- `validate_judge_report.py`: Reconciled `JUDGE_REGISTRY` plan set — removed phantom entries `efficiency-judge` and `informativeness-relevance-judge`; added `brownfield-accuracy-judge`, `codebase-grounding-judge`, and `convention-adherence-judge`
- `judge-input.schema.json`: Added `"prd"` to the `evaluation_type` enum

### code v1.1.3

#### Added
- `stream_formatter.py` now accumulates per-model token usage from assistant events and prints a summary in the format the harness expects, fixing zero token counts for PLAN/EXECUTE loops

#### Fixed
- `stream_formatter.py` returns early on `BrokenPipeError` before printing usage summary, preventing tracebacks when used in pipelines with early-exit consumers

### judges v1.2.0

#### Added
- New `brownfield-accuracy-judge` agent — evaluates how accurately a plan accounts for existing code (reuse vs reimplementation, integration-point accuracy, scope accuracy against investigation findings)
- New `codebase-grounding-judge` agent — detects hallucinated file paths, nonexistent modules, and fabricated APIs by comparing plan claims against the investigation log
- New `convention-adherence-judge` agent — evaluates whether a plan follows the conventions, patterns, and style found in the actual codebase as documented in the investigation log

#### Changed
- Updated `run-judges` skill to support 16 plan judges (up from 13), adding the three new grounding/brownfield/convention judges in Batch 4
- `brownfield-accuracy-judge` and `convention-adherence-judge` now invoke `@code:pre-explorer` to generate `investigation-log.md` when absent, instead of immediately scoring 0.5; fall back to 0.5 only if pre-explorer fails or the file remains absent
- `codebase-grounding-judge`: add validation step to ensure net-new code does not duplicate existing functionality (e.g., utilities/helpers already in codebase)

### code v1.1.2

#### Fixed
- Restored boolean semantics for `has_code_changes` in `run-loop.sh` and updated judge gating to skip code judges when no implementation changes are detected, without relying on numeric stdout parsing

### judges v1.1.0

#### Added
- New `context-manager-for-judges` agent (moved from `code` plugin) to orchestrate context compression for judge evaluation
- New `judge-input.schema.json` — formal JSON schema defining the standard judge input contract with `source_of_truth` field
- Investigation log (`investigation-log.md`) reuse in plan judge context with pre-explorer fallback when no `CLOSEDLOOP_WORKDIR` is set

#### Changed
- Generalized judge input contract to use orchestrator-provided `judge-input.json` (task + context envelope) instead of hardcoded artifact assumptions
- Standardized all judge agents to read `judge-input.json` from `$CLOSEDLOOP_WORKDIR` and load mapped artifacts via source-of-truth ordering
- Centralized judge input-read requirements into shared preamble `common_input_preamble.md`; judge-specific files no longer duplicate input-contract boilerplate
- Enforced strict SSOT by removing residual per-agent `Input Contract` stubs; `common_input_preamble.md` is now the single runtime source for input-loading guidance

#### Fixed
- Added `source_of_truth` to required array in `judge-input.schema.json` — schema now matches SKILL.md and judge agent expectations for evidence prioritization

### code v1.1.0

#### Changed
- Migrated session/hook data directory from `.claude/.closedloop/` to `.closedloop-ai/` across all hooks (`session-start`, `session-end`, `subagent-start`, `subagent-stop`, `pretooluse`, `loop-stop`) and `setup-closedloop.sh`, with legacy fallback for mid-upgrade sessions
- Added legacy directory cleanup in `session-end-hook.sh` — removes stale PID mappings, expired session files, and deletes empty legacy directory on session end

### self-learning v1.0.3

#### Fixed
- Fixed pattern cap trimming to sort by staleness flags only instead of confidence — low-confidence patterns were always dropped before being observed, preventing them from ever earning higher confidence
- Fixed extraneous f-string prefix lint warning in `write_merged_patterns.py` default header

#### Changed
- Updated `process-learnings` cap strategy to trim `[PRUNE]` then `[STALE]` then `[REVIEW]`, with `seen_count` as tiebreaker

### code v1.1.1

#### Added
- Integrated `investigation-log.md` into judge context assembly, sourced from `$CLOSEDLOOP_WORKDIR`

#### Fixed
- Fixed judges agents path resolution in `run-loop.sh` to support monorepo, cache, and marketplace installation layouts via a four-level fallback strategy (`CLOSEDLOOP_JUDGES_AGENTS_DIR` env override → repo-relative path → non-versioned sibling → latest semver-versioned sibling)
- Fixed agent snapshot to read judge agents from the judges plugin rather than the code plugin, and corrected `plugin` field in manifest to `"judges"`

### code-review v1.1.0

#### Breaking
- Removed `github-review` slash command — `/code-review:github-review` is no longer a valid entry point. Use `/code-review:start --github` instead.
- Renamed `review.md` → `start.md` — slash command is now `/code-review:start`
- Moved `github-review.md` from `commands/` to `prompts/` — callers using `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/commands/github-review.md` must update to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/prompts/github-review.md`

#### Changed
- Unified session directory path for all modes — removed `$RUNNER_TEMP` override in GitHub CI, now uses `.closedloop-ai/code-review/cr-<RANDOM>` everywhere
- Replaced Bash heredoc/cat usage with Write and Read tools for PR metadata file operations in `github-review.md`
- Updated temp file path references from `$RUNNER_TEMP/cr-review/` to `<CR_DIR>/*` in GitHub mode constraints
- Fixed usage examples to use `/start` to match the command filename
- Fixed internal references from `code-review-github.md` to `github-review.md`

#### Added
- Compound Bash command prohibition in GitHub mode — no `&&`, `||`, `;`, or `|` pipes allowed

### code v1.0.5

#### Changed
- Updated `review-delta.schema.json` description to reference "code hybrid workflow" instead of "impl-plan hybrid workflow"
- Updated `compliance-checkpoint.md` to reference `/code` instead of `/impl-plan`
- Removed `Bash` from `visual-qa-subagent` tool list to prevent shell access during visual QA

#### Security
- Added credential theft blocklist to `pretooluse-hook.sh`: denies Bash commands and file access targeting macOS Keychain, browser cookie databases, SSH private keys, and cloud credentials
- Blocklist applies to all Claude sessions, not just ClosedLoop-managed sessions

### bootstrap v1.1.0

#### Added
- Schema-aligned constraints in AGENT_FORMAT.md: `tools`, `skills`, `permissionMode` fields, `name` kebab-case/64-char limit, `description` 1024-char limit, expanded 8-color enum with `cyan`/`pink`
- Context-engineering activation in agent-prompt-generator via `platform:context-engineering` skill
- Tools/skills inline format validation in agent-prompt-validator (BLOCKING on block array syntax)
- `additionalProperties` violation detection and `skills`→`Skill` tool cross-check
- Critic Review Schema Alignment (Check 8) and critic-gates.json Structure Validation (Check 9) in generation-validator
- critic-gates.json schema validation in bootstrap-validator
- Context-engineering compliance warnings in anti-pattern detection

#### Changed
- `description` max raised from 120 → 1024 chars (warn >200)
- `model` enum now accepts `inherit`
- `color` field changed from required to optional; enum expanded to 8 values
- Removed legacy `prd2plan/` directory namespace — agent output now writes to `.claude/agents/` (flat)
- Moved `.bootstrap-metadata.json` from `.claude/agents/prd2plan/` to `.closedloop-ai/bootstrap-metadata.json`
- Replaced all `/impl-plan` command references with `/code`
- Removed DAG validation infrastructure (deleted `impl-plan-dag.schema.json`, removed Check 2 from bootstrap-validator)
- Updated default `--target-command` from `impl-plan` to `code`
- Updated default `--output-dir` from `.claude/agents/prd2plan/` to `.claude/agents/`

### code v1.0.4

#### Changed
- Generalized `prd-creator` skill description and replaced analytics discovery step with risks assessment
- Updated PRD template to add compliance checkpoint and remove event instrumentation section
- Revised story patterns and examples references to align with compliance-focused workflow

#### Removed
- Deleted `event-instrumentation.md` reference

### code v1.0.3
